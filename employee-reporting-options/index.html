<h2>EMPLOYEES: OPTIONS TO RAISE A COMPLAINT OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT</h2>

<p>
RISD has instituted guidelines for raising complaints about harassment, including sexual harassment.
</p>

<p>File an Anonymous Report or a Confidential Report</p>
<p>Employees who wish to anonymously inform the College of a case of sexual misconduct by a RISD student or employee may report an incident anonymously. Individuals can use the Whistleblower Form available at XXX</p>

<p>Contact the RISD Public Safety anonymously at 401-454-XXXX</p>

<p>You can contact Elizabeth Tierney or a Deputy Title IX Coordinator.</p>

<h3>Informal Options</h3>
<p>There are informal options available to employees to try to address certain misconduct. There are many kinds of informal methods to resolve complaints, as noted below. One option, mediation, may be particularly useful for allegations of sexual misconduct (other than assault). </p>

<p>Mediation is a confidential process in which both the complainant and the respondent are helped by a trained mediator to reach a resolution. Mediation is designed to resolve complaints quickly, efficiently and to the mutual satisfaction of all parties involved. Mediators are trained to be neutral and not to take sides with either person. Resolutions reached are often put into writing. They are not kept by the mediator. They also are not kept by RISD, nor are they monitored or enforced by the Institute, unless specifically stated in the written agreement. Formal mediation can be especially useful where there are differences in perception or values or when the complainant wants to protect one's privacy. This is a voluntary process for everyone involved and will be pursued only with the consent of both parties. It is important to note that mediation is not appropriate for certain cases, including those involving allegations of sexual assault, even on a voluntary basis.</p>

<p>In cases where mediation is deemed to be an option, a complainant wishing to pursue mediation should contact the Human Resources office.</p>


<h3>Formal complaint</h3>
<p>To pursue a formal complaint, an employee should submit a complaint in writing to the Human Resources Office on campus or to the Dean of Students Office (for students). </p>

<p>An employee complaint will be reviewed and a decision will be made as to how RISD will respond. RISD will conduct an investigation of a complaint of sexual misconduct. Investigations are done by an impartial investigator, giving notice to the person who allegedly offended and providing a reasonable opportunity for that person to respond to the major elements of the complaint and information presented. An investigation and decision on a complaint can lead to serious disciplinary action, which may include termination.</p>

<p>In a sexual misconduct matter, the complainant and respondent can appeal a decision on the complaint. Such appeal must be in writing, filed promptly with the Human Resources Office, and state the reasons supporting the appeal.</p>
