<h2>Sexual Misconduct Policy</h2>
<p>RISD is committed to providing a productive living and learning community in which students can pursue their educational goals. Sexual misconduct undermines this commitment and affects the ability of students to focus on their educational achievement. Therefore, RISD will not tolerate nor condone any form of sexual misconduct. RISD students are prohibited from engaging in sexual misconduct, as defined below. No one shall be retaliated against for participating in the college’s complaint resolution procedure in good faith as a complainant, a witness, an investigator, or in any other capacity.</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<p>Due to the sensitive and sometimes violent nature of incidents involving sexual misconduct, the following definitions are provided for informational use by students and for guidance in the investigation and processing of alleged violations. It is possible that a particular action may constitute sexual misconduct even if not specifically mentioned in these examples.</p>
 
<p>Sexual misconduct is a broad term used to encompass a range of behaviors including sexual harassment, nonconsensual sexual contact, nonconsensual sexual penetration, and sexual exploitation. Some behaviors covered by these definitions might be referred to as rape, sexual assault, or sexual battery in criminal statutes. Terms that are also used culturally include date rape, acquaintance rape, or intimate partner violence. Sexual misconduct can occur between individuals who know each other, have an established relationship, have previously engaged in consensual sexual activity, and between individuals who do not know each other. Sexual misconduct can be committed by persons of any gender identity, and it can occur between people of the same or different sex.</p>
 
<p>RISD students are expected to engage in sexual behavior of any kind only with the fully informed and effective consent of all parties involved. Effective consent must be obtained for each instance and each escalation of sexual activity. Obtaining effective consent is the responsibility of the party initiating sexual activity. Doing otherwise may constitute sexual misconduct and is a violation of RISD policy.</p>
 
<p><strong>Sexual Harassment</strong> is unwelcome conduct of a sexual nature, such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature, when:
submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a condition of an individual’s employment or academic standing; or submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as the basis for employment decisions (such as advancement, performance evaluation, or work schedule) or academic decisions (such as grading or letters of recommendation); or such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual’s working conditions, academic experience, or living conditions, or of creating a hostile working, academic, or living environment.</p>

<p>Even one instance of sexual harassment, if severe enough, may create a hostile environment. A non-exhaustive set of examples of conduct that might constitute sexual harassment are included below.  One or more of these actions will only be considered sexual harassment when that conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with another individual’s working conditions, academic experience, or living conditions, or of creating a hostile working, academic or living environment.</p>
 
<p>Examples of <strong>verbal sexual harassment</strong> may include unwelcome conduct such as unwelcome sexual flirtation, advances or propositions or requests for sexual activity or dates; asking about someone else's sexual activities, fantasies, preferences, or history; discussing one’s own sexual activities, fantasies, preferences, or history; verbal abuse of a sexual nature; suggestive comments; sexually explicit jokes; turning discussions at work or in the academic environment to sexual topics; and making offensive sounds such as smacking or licking lips, kissing sounds, or "wolf whistles."</p>
 
<p>Examples of <strong>nonverbal sexual harassment</strong> include unwelcome conduct such as displaying sexual objects, pictures or other images; invading a person's personal body space, such as standing closer than appropriate or necessary or hovering; displaying or wearing objects or items of clothing which express sexually offensive comments; making sexual gestures with hands or body movements; looking at a person in a sexually suggestive or intimidating manner; or delivering unwanted letters, gifts, or other items of a sexual nature. In addition, nonconsensual sexual contact, sexual exploitation, and nonconsensual sexual penetration may constitute nonverbal instances of sexual harassment.</p>
 
<p>Sexual harassment does not include material or discussion that is appropriately related to course subject matter or curriculum, and this policy shall not abridge academic freedom or the RISD‘s  educational mission.</p>
 
<p><strong>Nonconsensual sexual contact</strong> is defined as any physical contact with another person of a sexual nature without that person’s effective consent. The touching of a person’s intimate parts (such as genitalia, groin, breast, buttocks, mouth, or clothing covering same); touching a person with one’s own intimate parts; or forcing a person to touch another’s intimate parts would be violations of this policy if they occur without effective consent. </p>
 
<p><strong>Nonconsensual sexual penetration</strong> is defined as the sexual penetration of any bodily opening with any object or body part without effective consent. This could be committed by force, threat, intimidation, coercion, or through exploitation of another’s mental or physical condition (such as lack of consciousness, incapacitation due to drugs or alcohol, age, or disability) of which the respondent was actually aware or which a reasonable person in the respondent’s position should have been aware.</p>
 
<p><strong>Sexual exploitation</strong> means taking sexual advantage of another person and includes, without limitation: indecent exposure; causing or attempting to cause the incapacitation of another person in order to gain a sexual advantage over him or her; causing the prostitution of another person; recording, photographing, or transmitting images of private sexual activity and/or the intimate parts of another person without effective consent; allowing third parties to observe private sexual acts without effective consent; engaging in voyeurism without effective consent; and knowingly or recklessly exposing another person to a significant risk of sexually transmitted infection, including HIV.</p>
 
<p>In order for consent to be effective, these are the minimal conditions that should be met:</p>
<li>The person must be able to understand exactly what it is that they are agreeing to and no incapacitated.</li>
<li>Incapacitation includes incapacitation by drugs or alcohol to the point that a person’s state of mind is not clear and their judgment is impaired. We define incapacitation by drugs or alcohol as follows: a person is incapable to give effective consent to a sexual act.</li>
<li>When alcohol or other drugs are being used, someone will be considered unable to give effective consent if they cannot appreciate the Who, What, When, Where, Why, or How of a sexual interaction. Individuals who consent to sex may be able to understand what they are doing.</li>
<li>To be more precise, an incapacitated person cannot give effective consent. Even if they express willingness to engage in sexual activity but are incapacitated at the time, and that the individual is incapacitated is known or should be known to the accused [respondent], any sexual activity that takes place is misconduct and any factual willingness that may have been expressed is irrelevant. </li>

<p>A person cannot give consent if any of the following factors are present:</p>

<li>Someone forces someone to engage in sexual activity.</li>
<li>Someone threatens force against another.</li>
<li>Someone coerces or intimidates someone into sexual activity.</li>
<li>Verbal coercion violates this policy as much as the use of physical force. </li>
<li>The person is mentally incapacitated.</li>
<li>Mental incapacitated could refer to a person with a  severe cognitive disability or a person who is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs.</li>
<li>The person is physically helpless.</li>
<li>Physically helpless could refer to a person with a physical disability, an injury, or someone who is passed out, among other things.</li>
<li>Or the person is a minor.</li>
<li>If a person is slurring their words, having difficulty maintaining equilibrium, passing in and out of consciousness, or is vomiting, they can safely be considered to be incapacitated. </li>
<li>Incapacitation may exist in the absence of these symptoms.</li> 
<li>Incapacity is not determined by a person’s Blood Alcohol Content level.</li> 


<p>OR ~</p>

<p>Effective Consent is:
informed;
freely and actively given;
mutually understandable words or actions;
which indicate a willingness to participate in
mutually agreed upon sexual activity
</p>

<p><p>Further:</p>
Initiators of sexual activity are responsible for obtaining effective consent.
Silence or passivity is not effective consent.
The use of intimidation, coercion, threats, force, or violence negates any consent obtained.
Consent is not effective if obtained from an individual who is incapable of giving consent due to the following or other reasons:
a mental, intellectual, or physical disability; or
is under the legal age to give consent; or
is asleep, unconscious, or physically helpless;
is incapacitated by alcohol or other drugs.</p>

<p>Consent to one type of sexual activity does not imply consent to any other or all types of sexual activity.
A person can withdraw consent at any time.
Consent to sexual activity at one time does not imply consent to the same or other sexual activity at any other time.
Refusal, lack of consent, or non-consent may be expressed in many ways, verbally or physically. Physical resistance is not necessary to communicate a lack of consent.</p>

<p>Individuals who initiate sexual activity assume responsibility for their behavior and must understand that the use of alcohol or other drugs does not reduce accountability for their actions. The question is whether or not the person who initiated the sexual activity knew or whether a sober and reasonable person in the same position should have known whether the other person gave effective consent. </p>
 
<p>Incapacitation is the physical and/or mental inability to make informed, rational judgments and decisions. States of incapacitation include sleep and blackouts. Where alcohol or other substances are involved, incapacitation is determined by how the substance impacts a person’s decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make informed judgments. </p>
 
<p>Coercion is to force one to act based on fear of harm to self or others. Means of coercion may include, but are not limited to, pressure, threats, emotional intimidation, or the use of physical force.</p>
 
<p>Force may include words, conduct or appearance. Force includes causing another’s intoxication or impairment through the use of drugs or alcohol. Coercion, intimidation, and non-physical threats can be all forms of force.</p>
 
<p>Students are encouraged to report sexual misconduct that is perpetrated against them or other members of the RISD community. Students have numerous options for reporting the misconduct and obtaining support; which option a student chooses depends upon the nature and severity of the misconduct, whether the student wishes the report to remain confidential, and whether the student wishes to pursue a formal complaint. </p>

<h3>RISD’s Response</h3>
<p>Except in those cases where the student has contacted a strictly confidential resource, the College will conduct a prompt, thorough and impartial investigation and will take appropriate measures to terminate the misconduct, prevent its recurrence and address its effects. This response may include formal disciplinary action, which may be instituted by an individual complainant or the Institute itself. The sanctions of disciplinary suspension and disciplinary expulsion will be strongly considered when a student is found to have violated any part of the nonconsensual sexual contact, nonconsensual sexual penetration, sexual exploitation, or retaliation provisions of this policy; and for severe violations of the sexual harassment provision.</p>
 
<h3>Interim Measures</h3>
<p>While an investigation or grievance proceeding is pending, RISD will take interim measures as appropriate under the circumstances to assist or protect persons who were or may have been subjected to sexual misconduct. Interim measures may include, for example, changing the living arrangements, class schedule, or work schedule of the person who was subject of the alleged misconduct and/or the person alleged to have committed the misconduct, or similar action. Such measures may also include connecting the persons who were or may have been subjected to sexual misconduct with counseling, health care, academic support, or other resources. Support services for respondents are also available.</p>



<h3>INTIMATE PARTNER (RELATIONSHIP) VIOLENCE </h3>
<p>Given the unique nature of intimate partner violence, RISD developed the following policy to address the dynamics of abuse that can occur in relationships (IPV – sometimes referred to as dating violence, relationship violence, or domestic violence).</p>

<p>Intimate Partner Violence Behaviors is defined as a pattern of coercive behavior that one partner exerts over the other for the purpose of establishing and maintaining power and control. This type of violence does not require sexual intimacy. The term ‘partner’ for this policy will include: current or former partner(s); and will include persons who are married or living together as a couple to persons who are dating or who consider themselves a couple (individuals engaged in a primary romantic and/or sexual relationship with another) but have separate living arrangements. IPV can vary in frequency and severity. It occurs on a continuum, ranging from name calling, to a single hit that may or may not impact the victim to chronic, severe mental abuse and battering.</p>

There are four main types of intimate partner violence:
<li>Physical violence: is the intentional use of physical force with the potential for causing death, disability, injury, or harm. Physical violence includes, but is not limited to, scratching; pushing; shoving; throwing; grabbing; biting; choking; shaking; slapping; punching; burning; use of a weapon; and use of restraints or one's body, size, or strength against another person.</li>
<li>Sexual violence: is a sexual act without consent.</li>
<li>Threats of physical or sexual violence: use of words, gestures, or weapons to communicate the intent to cause death, disability, injury, or physical harm.</li>
<li>Psychological/emotional violence: involves trauma to the victim caused by acts, threats of acts, or coercive tactics. Psychological/emotional abuse can include, but is not limited to, humiliating the victim, controlling what the victim can and cannot do, withholding information from the victim, deliberately doing something to make the victim feel diminished or embarrassed, isolating the victim from friends and family, and denying the victim access to money or other basic resources. </li>

<p>In addition, stalking is often included among the types Intimate Partner Violence</p>

<p>Stalking refers to "harassing or threatening behavior that an individual engages in repeatedly, such as following a person, appearing at a person's home or place of business, making harassing phone calls, leaving written messages or objects, or vandalizing a person's property. Stalking can be further defined as a course of conduct directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. Course of conduct is defined as “a pattern of actions composed of more than one act over a period of time, however short, evidencing a continuity of conduct.”
Stalking Behaviors include any behaviors or activities occurring on more than one occasion that collectively instill fear in a victim, and/or threaten her or his safety, mental health, or physical health. Such behaviors and activities may include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>

• <li>Non-consensual communication, including face-to-face communication, telephone calls, voice messages, e-mails, text messages, written letters, gifts, or any other communications that are undesired and place another person in fear.</li>
• <li>Use of online, electronic, or digital technologies, including, but not limited to:</li>
o <li>Posting of pictures or information in chat rooms or on Web sites</li>
o <li>Sending unwanted/unsolicited email or talk/chat/text requests</li>
o <li>Posting private or public messages on Internet sites, social networking sites, and/or school bulletin boards</li>
o <li>Installing spyware on a victim’s computer</li>
o <li>Using Global Positioning Systems (GPS) to monitor a victim</li>
o <li>The unauthorized use of user names and passwords, PIN(s), and/or online identity</li>
• <li>Pursuing, following, waiting, or showing up uninvited at or near a residence, workplace, classroom, or other places frequented by the victim</li>
• <li>Surveillance or other types of observation including staring, “peeping”</li>
• <li>Trespassing</li>
• <li>Vandalism</li>
• <li>Non-consensual touching</li>
• <li>Direct verbal or physical threats</li>
• <li>Gathering information about an individual from friends, family, and/or co-workers</li>
• <li>Threats to harm self or others</li>
• <li>Defamation – lying to others about the victim</li>

<h3>PROCEDURES FOR RESPONDING TO A CASE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT</h3>
<p>Good Samaritan (Amnesty) and Responsible Action Policies: RISD encourages the reporting of policy violations and crimes. As well, RISD encourages students to offer help and assistance to others in need. Sometimes students are hesitant to report an alleged policy violation to college officials because they fear that they themselves may be accused of policy violations, such as underage drinking at the time of the incident. Sometimes, students are hesitant to offer assistance to others; for fear that they may get themselves in trouble. RISD pursues a policy of offering victims and witnesses of sexual violations amnesty from other policy violations, such as consumption of drugs or alcohol related to the incident. </p>

<p>RISD pursues a policy of limited immunity for students who offer help to others in need. While policy violations cannot be overlooked, the college will provide educational options, rather than mere punitive actions, to those who offer their assistance to others in need.</p>

<p>Members of the RISD community are strongly encouraged to promptly report all incidents of sexual misconduct. Prompt reporting of such incidents makes investigation of the incident more effective and enhances the ability of RISD to take action. Any RISD student who believes he or she has been subjected to sexual misconduct by another RISD student may initiate a complaint by speaking to any of the Title IX coordinators or deputy coordinators. However, any RISD supervisor (such as faculty, dean or other administrator, residence life staff or supervisor) who is informed of an allegation of sexual misconduct involving an RISD student, but is not specifically a Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinator must direct the complainant or otherwise refer the complaint to a Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinator. Certain RISD officials who serve in a privileged professional capacity (i.e., medical providers and mental health counselors) are not bound by this requirement.</p>

<p>This policy applies to any allegation of sexual misconduct brought against a RISD student regardless of where the alleged sexual misconduct occurred. For members of the RISD community there is no geographical limitation to invoking this policy. With respect to any complaint by a person who is not a member of the RISD community and/or involves conduct occurring at a significant distance from campus, RISD will determine whether the conduct described in the complaint constitutes a sufficient risk to the RISD community to warrant further review of the complaint.</p>

<p>In addition to raising a complaint within RISD, individuals may also file a criminal complaint with the Providence Police or the local law enforcement agency where the misconduct occurred. The standards for finding a violation of law are different from the standards used by RISD in determining whether there has been a violation of RISD’s policy. The filing of a complaint of sexual misconduct with RISD is independent of any criminal investigation or proceeding (although RISD’s investigation may be delayed temporarily while the criminal investigators are gathering evidence) and RISD may not wait for the conclusion of any criminal proceeding to start its own investigation.</p>

<h3>Review of Complaint</h3>
<p>Upon being notified of an allegation of sexual misconduct, a Title IX Coordinator or designee will meet with the complainant to provide the complainant with a copy of this Policy, to provide information on the available forms of support, to explain the various options for pursuing the matter, including going to the police, and to discuss any accommodations that may be appropriate concerning the complainant’s academic studies, housing and employment. At this meeting, a Title IX Coordinator or designee will seek to determine how a complainant wishes to proceed (i.e., whether the complainant wishes to pursue a formal complaint, informal resolution or does not wish to pursue any resolution). In all reports of alleged sexual misconduct, regardless of whether the complainant wishes to pursue the disciplinary process through the filing of a formal complaint, RISD will undertake some type of review.</p>

<p>Usually, the Title IX Coordinator will assign an individual to review the complaint (“the Investigator”). The Investigator will investigate the incident by separately questioning the complainant, the respondent and any identified witnesses. The Investigator may also request written materials from the parties and witnesses and has the discretion to confer with others as needed. At the conclusion of the investigation, the Investigator will report to the Title IX coordinator. Investigations shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible and normally shall be completed within twenty (20) days after receipt of the complaint, except where written policy says otherwise or when there is a legitimate reason as long as the complainant and respondent are notified. A report may also be prepared and submitted to the Dean of Students (or Student Conduct Coordinator?) if a complainant wants to pursue a formal complaint against the respondent. The XXX  will then decide whether a hearing by the Conduct Board is warranted. If a complainant does wish to pursue a complaint, the Dean for Students may be informed for any further action that might be taken.</p>

<h3>Interim Measures Available</h3>
<p>After receiving and initially reviewing a complaint of sexual misconduct, RISD may take interim measures to protect a complainant and/or the safety of the RISD community.  RISD may impose a “no-contact” order, which typically will instruct the parties to refrain from having contact with one another, directly or through intermediaries, whether in person or via electronic means, pending the investigation and, if applicable, the Conduct Board hearing. RISD may also take any further protective action that it decides is appropriate concerning the interaction of the parties pending resolution of the matter, including, without limitation, changing a complainant’s or respondent’s academic and/or living situation if those changes are requested by the complainant or respondent and are appropriate and reasonably available. Failure to comply with any interim measures is a violation of this policy and may lead to additional disciplinary measures.</p>

<p>During any stage of the investigation, if RISD reasonably suspects that a respondent poses a threat of harm or disruption to the campus community, RISD may take immediate action, including removing a respondent from housing, restricting the respondent’s movement on campus, and/or temporarily suspending the respondent from RISD. </p>
