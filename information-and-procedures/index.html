<h2>Procedures for responding to a case of sexual misconduct</h2>
<p>Good Samaritan (Amnesty) and Responsible Action Policies: RISD encourages the reporting of policy violations and crimes. As well, RISD encourages students to offer help and assistance to others in need. Sometimes students are hesitant to report an alleged policy violation to college officials because they fear that they themselves may be accused of policy violations, such as underage drinking at the time of the incident. Sometimes, students are hesitant to offer assistance to others; for fear that they may get themselves in trouble. RISD pursues a policy of offering victims and witnesses of sexual violations amnesty from other policy violations, such as consumption of drugs or alcohol related to the incident.</p> 

<p>RISD pursues a policy of limited immunity for students who offer help to others in need. While policy violations cannot be overlooked, the college will provide educational options, rather than mere punitive actions, to those who offer their assistance to others in need.</p>

<p>Members of the RISD community are strongly encouraged to promptly report all incidents of sexual misconduct. Prompt reporting of such incidents makes investigation of the incident more effective and enhances the ability of RISD to take action. Any RISD student who believes he or she has been subjected to sexual misconduct by another RISD student may initiate a complaint by speaking to any of the Title IX coordinators or deputy coordinators. However, any RISD supervisor (such as faculty, dean or other administrator, residence life staff or supervisor) who is informed of an allegation of sexual misconduct involving an RISD student, but is not specifically a Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinator must direct the complainant or otherwise refer the complaint to a Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinator. Certain RISD officials who serve in a privileged professional capacity (i.e., medical providers and mental health counselors) are not bound by this requirement.</p>

<p>This policy applies to any allegation of sexual misconduct brought against a RISD student regardless of where the alleged sexual misconduct occurred. For members of the RISD community there is no geographical limitation to invoking this policy. With respect to any complaint by a person who is not a member of the RISD community and/or involves conduct occurring at a significant distance from campus, RISD will determine whether the conduct described in the complaint constitutes a sufficient risk to the RISD community to warrant further review of the complaint.</p>

<p>In addition to raising a complaint within RISD, individuals may also file a criminal complaint with the Providence Police or the local law enforcement agency where the misconduct occurred. The standards for finding a violation of law are different from the standards used by RISD in determining whether there has been a violation of RISD’s policy. The filing of a complaint of sexual misconduct with RISD is independent of any criminal investigation or proceeding (although RISD’s investigation may be delayed temporarily while the criminal investigators are gathering evidence) and RISD may not wait for the conclusion of any criminal proceeding to start its own investigation.</p>

<h3>Review of Complaint</h3>
<p>Upon being notified of an allegation of sexual misconduct, a Title IX Coordinator or designee will meet with the complainant to provide the complainant with a copy of this Policy, to provide information on the available forms of support, to explain the various options for pursuing the matter, including going to the police, and to discuss any accommodations that may be appropriate concerning the complainant’s academic studies, housing and employment. At this meeting, a Title IX Coordinator or designee will seek to determine how a complainant wishes to proceed (i.e., whether the complainant wishes to pursue a formal complaint, informal resolution or does not wish to pursue any resolution). In all reports of alleged sexual misconduct, regardless of whether the complainant wishes to pursue the disciplinary process through the filing of a formal complaint, RISD will undertake some type of review.</p>

<p>Usually, the Title IX Coordinator will assign an individual to review the complaint (“the Investigator”). The Investigator will investigate the incident by separately questioning the complainant, the respondent and any identified witnesses. The Investigator may also request written materials from the parties and witnesses and has the discretion to confer with others as needed. At the conclusion of the investigation, the Investigator will report to the Title IX coordinator. Investigations shall be conducted as expeditiously as possible and normally shall be completed within twenty (20) days after receipt of the complaint, except where written policy says otherwise or when there is a legitimate reason as long as the complainant and respondent are notified. A report may also be prepared and submitted to the Dean of Students (or Student Conduct Coordinator?) if a complainant wants to pursue a formal complaint against the respondent. The XXX  will then decide whether a hearing by the Conduct Board is warranted. If a complainant does wish to pursue a complaint, the Dean for Students may be informed for any further action that might be taken.</p>

<h3>Interim Measures Available</h3>
<p>After receiving and initially reviewing a complaint of sexual misconduct, RISD may take interim measures to protect a complainant and/or the safety of the RISD community.  RISD may impose a “no-contact” order, which typically will instruct the parties to refrain from having contact with one another, directly or through intermediaries, whether in person or via electronic means, pending the investigation and, if applicable, the Conduct Board hearing. RISD may also take any further protective action that it decides is appropriate concerning the interaction of the parties pending resolution of the matter, including, without limitation, changing a complainant’s or respondent’s academic and/or living situation if those changes are requested by the complainant or respondent and are appropriate and reasonably available. Failure to comply with any interim measures is a violation of this policy and may lead to additional disciplinary measures.</p>

<p>During any stage of the investigation, if RISD reasonably suspects that a respondent poses a threat of harm or disruption to the campus community, RISD may take immediate action, including removing a respondent from housing, restricting the respondent’s movement on campus, and/or temporarily suspending the respondent from RISD. </p>
