<h2>Title IX Coordinators</h2>
<p>Any student, faculty or staff member, who has concerns about sex discrimination, including any concerns pertaining to sexual misconduct, is encouraged to seek the assistance of those listed below. Coordinators are knowledgeable about, and will provide information on resources for assistance and options to address concerns. Those options may vary depending on the nature of the complaint, whether the complainant is a student, faculty or staff member, the wishes of the complainant regarding confidentiality, and whether the complainant prefers to proceed formally or informally. Together, the advisors play an integral role in carrying out RISDâ€™s commitment to provide a positive learning, teaching and working environment for the entire community. </p>
