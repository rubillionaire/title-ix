<p>RISD is committed to creating and providing a learning, living and working environment free from discrimination including sexual harassment and sexual violence.  Members of our community, guests and visitors have the right to be free from all forms of violence and abuse, including sexual and relationship violence, stalking, sexual harassment and hate crimes. All members of our community, including guests and visitors, are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that does not infringe upon the rights of others.</p>

<p>RISD complies with applicable state and federal statutes, including Title IX of the federal Higher Education Amendment of 1972, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex under any education program or activity receiving federal financial aid. Sexual assault and sexual harassment is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title IX.
Gender based discrimination, including sexual misconduct and sexual harassment, committed by RISD students, staff or faculty will not be tolerated. This applies to academic, educational, athletic, residential and other RISD operated programs. RISD encourages individuals who believe they have been sexually harassed, assaulted or subjected to sexual misconduct by a RISD student or employee to seek assistance. RISD provides a variety of options available to an individual, so that each person may choose a path for response best suited to his or her particular situation. RISD procedures are intended to protect the rights of the complaining party (“the complainant”), the accused (“the respondent”) and other participants in investigations of complaints.</p>

<p>Any allegation of sexual misconduct brought against a RISD student or employee, regardless of where the alleged sexual misconduct occurred, will be taken seriously. Sexual misconduct alleged to have occurred off the RISD campus may be more difficult to investigate. If a person who is not a member of the RISD community notifies RISD of alleged sexual misconduct by a RISD student or employee RISD will determine whether the conduct described is a sufficient risk to the safety of the RISD community to review further.</p>

<p>Sarah Caggiano serves as the Title IX Coordinators and is responsible for tracking and monitoring incidents of gender based discrimination, including sexual misconduct, to ensure that RISD responds effectively to each complaint, and, where necessary, to conduct an investigation of a particular situation. RISD has also designated two Deputy Title IX Coordinators who have been trained to assist individuals with concerns of this nature: Elizabeth Tierney (for employees) and Sydney Lake (for students). </p>
